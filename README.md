## Project Description  
DriveWise is an innovative driving analytics mobile application designed to promote safer driving practices and provide in-depth driving behavior analysis. Using your smartphone's built-in sensors such as the accelerometer, gyroscope, and GPS, DriveWise tracks and analyzes driving behavior to detect sudden braking, sharp turns, rapid acceleration, and more.  

With its gamification features, DriveWise encourages users to achieve better driving scores by competing against their previous performance and earning badges for milestones. This app is ideal for users who want to improve their driving habits while enjoying a fun and interactive experience.  

## Features  
- **Driving Behavior Analyzer**: Detects sudden braking, sharp turns, and rapid acceleration using smartphone sensors.  
- **GPS-Based Speed Tracking**: Monitors vehicle speed and provides real-time tracking.  
- **Trip Tracking**: Logs trip start and end times, locations, speeds, and specific driving events.  
- **Gamification**: Awards badges for achieving milestones and allows users to compete against their previous monthly scores.  
- **Detailed Reports**: Provides insights into driving performance and event-specific analysis.  

## Technologies and Tools
